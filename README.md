# Vivace

Vivace is a music website aimed to provide statistics, links, and news about music all in one place.

### Why?

As part of A-Level Computer Science, I have to do an NEA, and I decided to make this.

### What does the -basic mean?

This is a draft so I don't make a hot steaming pile of shit that might pass as code and then have to submit it when it's essentially unreadable.

### Why Python?

Shits and gigs innit.
